#Forkify project

Forkify is a modern recipe application that lets users search for meals, view full cooking details, scale ingredient quantities by servings, save bookmarks in local storage, and add custom recipes.
The project is built with vanilla JavaScript using an MVC-style architecture, bundled with Parcel, and styled with Sass for a clean UI.
